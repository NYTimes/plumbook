Plum Book
===========

This repository contains data from the 2012 edition of the Plum Book, which is published by the Government Printing Office. From [its description](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012/content-detail.html): "Every four years, just after the Presidential election, the United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions, commonly known as the Plum Book, is published, alternately, by the Senate and the House. The Plum Book is used to identify presidentially appointed positions within the Federal Government."

The 2012 data is contained in individual YAML and JSON files for each position. The 2012 data comes from [the mobile app version of the Plum Book](http://m.gpo.gov/plumbook/) and does not include positions that are filled by career incumbents (hence the gap in file names).

These files and the data they contain are generated by the federal government and are in the public domain.
